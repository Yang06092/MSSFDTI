# **MSSFDTI: Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) Prediction**

## **Introduction**
Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is crucial for drug repositioning and multi-target therapies, especially for treating complex diseases. Recent advancements in graph representation learning have made significant progress in the field. However, current methods, based on nearest-neighbor aggregation of structural similarity, often fail to capture long-range synergistic effects across molecular substructures. Additionally, they tend to simplify or overlook the characterization of complex molecular interactions involving multiple binding types.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce **MSSFDTI**, a novel framework for DTI prediction. The model encodes drug and target representations via a **multi-hop graph neural network**, which incorporates an **adaptive weight learning mechanism**. This mechanism explicitly captures cross-order relationships between direct binding and indirect regulatory interactions, addressing the critical issue of insufficient long-range dependency modeling across molecular substructures.

Furthermore, the encoded features are processed through a **multi-scale deep interaction mechanism**, which simultaneously models both the local conformational match and global functional relevance of drug-target interactions. This approach significantly enhances the modelâ€™s ability to represent complex molecular interactions.

In extensive comparisons with six state-of-the-art methods, **MSSFDTI** demonstrates significantly superior performance on two widely used benchmark datasets. Additionally, case studies show that our method effectively identifies novel binding targets for multi-target drugs, offering valuable insights for DTI prediction.

## **Quick Start**

Follow the steps below to run the model in a **Linux environment**:

### **1. Pre-training Phase**
Run the **pretraining** script to integrate drug similarity networks and target similarity networks. This step prepares the necessary features for the model.

```bash
python3 /path/to/MSSFDTI-main/src/pretrain_code/pretrain.py
```
Make sure to replace `/path/to/` with the actual directory path where the script is located.

### **2. Training Phase**
After pretraining, run the **training** script to train the model on the processed data.

```bash
python3 /path/to/MSSFDTI-main/src/train.py
```

This will start the training process for the DTI prediction model.
